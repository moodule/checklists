# Infrastructure Analysis

## Network Configuration

Map the network topography (host, services, domains and links) from:

| Description                                                            | Ok |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- |
| Network interfaces | |
| Routing tables | |
| ARP & NetBios tables | |
| DNS Servers | |
| Cached DNS entries | |
| Proxy servers | |
| ARP entries | |

## Network Services

| Description                                                            | Ok |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- |
| Identify all the network services offered by the target machine | |
| Compare to the result of the initial scanning | |
| Identify all VPN connections in and out of the target machine | |
| Enumerate users and hosts on directory services | |
| Leverage neighbor discovery protocols (CDP, LLDP, mDNS, NetBios, etc) | |
| Verify whether the discovered targets are in scope | |
